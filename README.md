# SOLDIER: SOLution for Dam Behavior Interpretation and Safety Evaluation

SOLDIER is an interactive application based on R-Shiny that facilitates the generation of machine-learning-based predictive models, their accuracy evaluation, and the analysis of predictor variables' effect on the dam behavior. This powerful tool is designed to aid dam engineers in identifying changes in dam behavior, detecting potential anomalies, and gaining a better understanding of the effect of loads on the dam structure. By leveraging machine learning techniques, SOLDIER aims to revolutionize the dam engineering sector and extend its application to structural health monitoring for other civil infrastructures.

## Introduction

The behavior and safety evaluation of dams are crucial aspects of dam engineering. SOLDIER, which stands for SOLution for Dam Behavior Interpretation and Safety Evaluation with Boosted Regression Trees, is a cutting-edge application that empowers engineers to harness the power of machine learning in the dam engineering domain. This interactive tool is built using R-Shiny and offers the capability to create predictive models, assess their accuracy, and gain valuable insights into the influence of predictor variables on the dam's response.

## Features

- **Predictive Model Generation:** SOLDIER allows users to create predictive models based on machine learning algorithms, particularly utilizing Boosted Regression Trees.
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** The application enables the evaluation of the accuracy and performance of the generated predictive models.
- **Variable Analysis:** SOLDIER facilitates the analysis of predictor variables to understand their impact on the dam behavior.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Engineers can use the application to detect potential anomalies in dam behavior, aiding in early identification of issues.
- **Structural Health Monitoring:** SOLDIER's capabilities extend beyond dams, offering the potential for application in monitoring the health of other civil infrastructures.

## Installation and Launch Guide

SOLDIER operates just like any other R-Shiny application. To run it on your local machine, consider following these recommended steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/soldier.git
   ```

2. **Install R:**
   Ensure you have R version 4.3.1 or a later version installed on your system. If you haven't installed R yet, you can download it from the official R website: [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/).

3. **Install RStudio:**
   RStudio provides an integrated development environment for working with R. You can download the latest version of RStudio from their official website: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Open RStudio on your machine.
   - Navigate to the cloned `soldier` directory.
   - Press the "Run App" button within RStudio.
   - The first time you run the application, it will install the necessary packages, which may take some time.

5. **Access the Application:**
   The application will open in your default web browser window, and you can start using SOLDIER.

Please ensure you have fulfilled the prerequisites mentioned above to ensure a smooth installation and execution of SOLDIER. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the project's documentation or seek support from the community.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired tasks:

1. **Model Generation:** Upload the dataset and select the relevant machine learning algorithm to create predictive models.

2. **Accuracy Evaluation:** Evaluate the accuracy of the generated models using provided evaluation metrics.

3. **Variable Analysis:** Explore the effect of predictor variables on the dam behavior and understand their significance.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Analyze the model predictions to detect potential anomalies in the dam's response.

Please note that while using SOLDIER, caution should be exercised in interpreting the results and making critical engineering decisions.
